Alten Learn Swedish Telegram Bot:
I try to develop an idea such as a mock project in few houres.Actually my goal was to 
use some technologies with develop this service.
This is a simple Telegram bot service which shows you swedish lessons(3 sample lessons).
By selecting the lesson button,it shows you the related words to learn.
It could be the infrustructure for a telegram bot to add more features.
I tried to use the following technologies to develop the project:
Spring Boot,
Java 8,
Telegram API,
Maven as build tools,
MonogDb as non sql database ,
Mockito as test tools,
Git as version control.
Setup guid line:
1. first install MongoDB if you do not have it.
2.create a database with the name of Telegram.
3.run the .jar file with name altenbot-0.1.jar .
4.in telegeram got to the bot with the name of  @AltenLearningBot.
5.enter /start to start the bot.
6.enter /showlessons command.
7.it show the available lessons.
8.by clicking on each lesson you will be able to see the words of that lesson.


finished :)
